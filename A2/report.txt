You can set the flags of whether to plot corners and randomly matched corners using the global variables mentioned on the top
You can also change the parameters of filtering to vary speed of processing based on different datasets.

Q1.
I implemented the hessian corner detector and took the hessian of the gaussian smoothened image using opencv derivative and
gaussian kernel functions. I later rendered a circle of yellow color on each of the detected corners

Q2.
I first detected corners in both the adjacent images. Now i iterated over corners of the first image and took the corner closest
to this corner in the second image and calculated the ssd distance between patches of size 5 surrounding these two corners. If this 
is less than some threshhold then I added this pair to matched set of tuples.

Q3.
